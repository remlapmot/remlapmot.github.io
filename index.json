This is an incredibly powerful command, which simply by issuing say\nversion 18 at the top of a do-file or within a program (typically in an ado-file) means that you have pretty much guaranteed your code will run in the same way when you come to run it later (most likely in a newer version of Stata).\nSeveral years ago I wrote the reffadjust package (Palmer et al. 2014) as part of some work using random effects models (Macdonald-Wallis et al. 2012). It has two programs reffadjustsim and reffadjust4nlcom which use the output of various random effects commands, including those from MLwiN, run from Stata using the user-written runmlwin command (Leckie and Charlton 2013).\nThe reffadjust package doesn’t have many users and over the years I hadn’t regularly checked if the programs were still working. But in the ado-files I had set version 13, which gave me some residual confidence that the programs might still work.\nHowever, a few years ago, when I eventually did run some test code I saw that the reffadjustsim tests were failing for MLwiN/runmlwin models. I didn’t have time to investigate further at this point, and I didn’t have any intuition whether the error resulted from a change in MLwiN, runmlwin, or Stata.\nAt the beginning of this year one of my colleagues mentioned that they were using reffadjust in their work and had observed the same error with reffadjustsim. My guilt kicked in, and I eventually found some time to investigate. I discovered that since I wrote the package, Stata processes matrix row and column stripes (essentially the row and column names) in a more advanced way. This meant that the row and column stripes for covariance elements in the e(V) matrix (the variance-covariance matrix of parameter estimates) from MLwiN/runmlwin models were being renamed when I hadn’t intended them to be which caused the error.\nBut wait … I had specified version 13 at the top of my program, so why was this update in later versions of Stata taking effect?\nI couldn’t work it out, so I had to ask Stata Technical Support. They were kind enough to tell me that there’s an additional method of invoking the version command which controls what is known as the “user version”. There are some modifications in new versions of Stata which are exempt from the basic invocation of the version command. The “user version”, is set by version #, user, and holds these additional modifications to the required version.\nNaturally, this is explained in the version helpfile and manual entry, which I admit I had not read until this point. Simply editing the top of my program to\nversion 13 version 13, user fixed my error. It turns out that both lines are required because the second line only sets the “user version”.\nIn summary, my reffadjustsim command works again for MLwiN/runmlwin models. If you ever need fuller reproducibility in your Stata do-file or program remember to set both the version and the user version.\nReferences Leckie, George, and Chris Charlton. 2013. “runmlwin: A Program to Run the MLwiN Multilevel Modeling Software from within Stata.” Journal of Statistical Software 52 (11): 1–40. https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v052.i11.

Because there are so many Linux distributions CRAN does not provide binary packages for Linux. Therefore, installing R packages on Linux can be slow because the bundled source packages need to be built on users machines.\nBut let’s install a package from the Posit (formerly RStudio) Package Manager on Ubuntu Linux. Woah! Something magical just happened, we installed a binary R package on Linux! How did that happen, let’s find out.1\nBuilding bundled source and binary packages I will use an example of one of my own packages OneSampleMR. I am running RStudio server on Ubuntu Linux, Focal Fossa through Windows Subsystem for Linux.\nThe package sources are in a Git repository hosted on GitHub, here. There is an .Rproj file, which we open in RStudio as a project.\nTo build an R package we require all of its dependency packages are installed, so we install those with devtools::install_dev_deps() and if your package requires any system libraries those must be installed too.\nThe Build pane gives us two convenient options, which will build either the bundled source package or binary package through calls to devtools::build(). Clicking on both in turn we see the following. The bundled source package has been built as OneSampleMR_0.1.2.tar.gz and the binary package has been built as OneSampleMR_0.1.2_R_x86_64-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz. Both files are in the directory above the project.\nWe can achieve the same output by making direct calls to R CMD build and R CMD install --build in a shell if preferred. We can test that these install as follows.\nCRAN structure for bundled source package files In two excellent blog posts Marks Sellors describes how to make a CRAN-like repository.2 There is also the miniCRAN package to help do this, but we don’t need to use this for the following explanation.\nTo host bundled source packages, such as our OneSampleMR_0.1.2.tar.gz file, we require the following directory structure (noting that the latest directory is optional, but allows us to add snapshot directories if we wanted to). /mycran └── latest └── src └── contrib └── 4.3.0 └── Recommended Specifically, we place the {package}_{version}.tar.gz files into the .../src/contrib directory. In that directory we then run\ntools::write_PACKAGES(type = \u0026quot;source\u0026quot;) which generates 3 additional files (PACKAGES, PACKAGES.gz, and PACKAGES.rds) which R will use to query what packages are available in our repository when its served on the web.\nAdding Windows and macOS binary R packages We saw above how to build a binary Linux package. The same process, when repeated on Windows will generate a file called {package}_{version}.zip and {package}_{version}.tgz on macOS (on Macs with both Intel and Apple Silicon processors).\nAssuming that we have some of these files we need to know where to put them. Since CRAN distributes binary packages for Windows and macOS we follow their directory structure, which is as follows. /mycran └── latest ├── bin │ ├── macosx │ │ ├── big-sur-arm64 │ │ │ └── contrib │ │ │ └── 4.2 │ │ └── contrib │ │ └── 4.2 │ └── windows │ └── contrib │ └── 4.2 └── src └── contrib └── 4.3.0 └── Recommended Noting that the current version of R is 4.2.2 and that the relevant directory name with the minor version number changes when R’s current minor version number changes, we place\nmacOS arm64 binary packages (for Macs with Apple Silicon processors) into the .../bin/macosx/big-sur-arm64/contrib/4.2/ directory macOS x86_64 binary packages (for Macs with Intel processors) into the .../bin/macosx/contrib/4.2/ directory, and Windows binary packages into the .../bin/windows/contrib/4.2/ directory. We then run tools::write_PACKAGES(type = \"mac.binary\") (changing to type = \"win.binary\" as required) in each of these directories to generate the 3 PACKAGES files.\nWe can confirm this directory structure using the contrib.url() function (the last command below was run on an Apple Silicon Mac).\ncontrib.url(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;, type = \u0026quot;source\u0026quot;) ## [1] \u0026quot;/src/contrib\u0026quot; contrib.url(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;, type = \u0026quot;win.binary\u0026quot;) ## [1] \u0026quot;/bin/windows/contrib/4.2\u0026quot; contrib.url(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;, type = \u0026quot;mac.binary\u0026quot;) ## [1] \u0026quot;/bin/macosx/contrib/4.2\u0026quot; contrib.url(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;, type = \u0026quot;binary\u0026quot;) ## [1] \u0026quot;/bin/macosx/big-sur-arm64/contrib/4.2\u0026quot; And they are also listed in the R Installation and Administration manual.3\nOn Apple Silicon Macs the big-sur-arm64 filepath corresponds to the end of .Platform$pkgType.\n.Platform$pkgType ## [1] \u0026quot;mac.binary.big-sur-arm64\u0026quot; Where to store and how to name Linux binary R packages? CRAN does not distribute Linux binary packages and so there is no directory structure from them to copy.\nHowever both the Posit Package Manager and the R4Pi project achieve this in a very clever way.4\nWe saw above that on Linux bundled source packages have filenames of the form {package}_{version}.tar.gz whereas the binary package filenames are of the form {package}_{version}_R_x86_64-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz (the text after {package}_{version}_ may be different depending on your machine and distro).\nTo distribute the Linux binary packages we create a parallel directory structure, which takes the same form as for the bundled source packages. In the case of Ubuntu Focal Fossa the Posit Package Manager uses __linux__/focal/latest/src/contrib.\nThey then rename the {package}_{version}_R_x86_64-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz files to the same form as the bundled source package files, i.e., to {package}_{version}.tar.gz. And they put them in this new src/contrib directory.\nThe structure of our CRAN-like repository (well in fact our 2 parallel repositories) is now. /mycran ├── __linux__ │ └── focal │ └── latest │ └── src │ └── contrib │ └── 4.3.0 │ └── Recommended └── latest ├── bin │ ├── macosx │ │ ├── big-sur-arm64 │ │ │ └── contrib │ │ │ └── 4.2 │ │ └── contrib │ │ └── 4.2 │ └── windows │ └── contrib │ └── 4.2 └── src └── contrib └── 4.3.0 └── Recommended We then run\ntools::write_PACKAGES(type = \u0026quot;source\u0026quot;) in the .../__linux__/distro-name/src/contrib directory for each Linux distribution to generate the PACKAGES files.\nOnce this directory structure is served we can set our repository in R to .../__linux__/focal/latest and R will find the binary package {package}_{version}.tar.gz files in the ...__linux__/focal/src/contrib/ directory, as per the first figure in this post.\nNote that the {package}_{version}.tar.gz files within __linux__/focal/latest/src/contrib do not all have to be of binary packages. They can be a mix of bundled source and binary packages, which is helpful if you haven’t had time to build all your binary package files.\nWe can also confirm that on Ubuntu Focal Fossa\n.Platform$pkgType ## [1] \u0026quot;source\u0026quot; therefore, on Linux, utils:::resolvePkgType() always returns \"source\". Hence, on Linux, contrib.url() always returns /src/contrib regardless of its type argument.\nTesting your CRAN-like repositories locally You can either run a local web server or use the file://... URL notation as your repos global options setting (set with option(repos = ...) or as the repos argument to install.packages()).\nHere’s a screenshot of installing a binary package on Ubuntu Focal Fossa. Summary We have taken a look at the structure of a CRAN-like repository and built bundled source and binary package files. We saw that the trick for distributing Linux binary packages is to make a parallel directory with the same structure as that required for bundled source packages and that we need to rename the binary package files to have the same filename format as the bundled source package files.\nNote that there are other approaches to distributing binary R packages on Linux, see
