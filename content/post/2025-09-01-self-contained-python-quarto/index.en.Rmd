## Introduction

In previous posts I have covered creating [effectively multi-engine Quarto documents](https://remlapmot.github.io/post/2025/multi-engine-quarto/) and also how to use [uv virtual environments for the nbstata Jupyter kernel](https://remlapmot.github.io/post/2025/nbstata-uv-venv/) to run Quarto documents with Stata code. Hence by trivial extension we can use `uv` to run Quarto documents using the `jupyter: python3` engine.

The slight inconvenience about this approach is that you end up leaving a README or shell script with the required commands to activate the environment, install the nbstata kernel, and run Quarto. At this point I wonder if I am deliberately trying to make my colleagues hate me.

A recent [post by Matt Dray](https://www.rostrum.blog/posts/2025-08-11-uv-standalone/) about using uv to implement self-contained Python scripts got me thinking. Could I produce a similar self-contained Python script to perform the rendering and avoid my colleagues the trouble of activating the virtual environment etc?

## The self-contained script

I came up with the following.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.9"
# dependencies = [
#     "jupyterlab>=4.4.3",
#     "jupyterlab-stata-highlight2>=0.1.2",
#     "nbstata>=0.8.2",
# ]
# ///
import subprocess

cmd0 = "python -m nbstata.install --sys-prefix"
retval0 = subprocess.call(cmd0, shell=True)
print('returned value:', retval0)

cmd1  = "quarto render --profile stata-questions"
retval1 = subprocess.call(cmd1, shell=True)
print('returned value:', retval1)

cmd2  = "quarto render --profile stata-solutions"
retval2 = subprocess.call(cmd2, shell=True)
print('returned value:', retval2)
```

* The first line, the shebang ensures it is run by `uv`
* Then the Python dependency libraries are declared between the
  ```python
  # /// script
  # ...
  # ///
  ```
  
  * If you don't use Stata, and only use `jupyter: python3` then you can delete the `jupyterlab-stata-highlight2` and `nbstata` entries and the first group of 3 lines for `cmd0`.
  * If you use additional Python packages in your code then you need to add them to the list.
* Then comes the actual code. These are simply system calls using the _subprocess_ module. You can amend the number of calls and the calls inside the string quotes as required. 

Save the script in a file, say _render_, then make it executable with

```sh
chmod +x render
```

Then all my colleagues need to do is run it with

```sh
./render
```

Of course uv and Quarto need to be installed and be on their `PATH`. Also for running Stata code, of course Stata is required to be installed. On Windows this needs to be run from a Git Bash shell rather than from Powershell or CMD shell.

The full documentation about uv scripts is [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/#creating-a-python-script).

If you are only using the Quarto knitr engine then you don't need this script. And I don't use the Python quarto package here as it's currently slightly too limited for my use (I'm not sure it can render profiles).

## Summary

I have shown how to make a self-contained Python script for rendering quarto documents within a uv virtual environment without having to do the leg work of creating the environment yourself. Hopefully this is helpful for slightly less technical colleagues.
