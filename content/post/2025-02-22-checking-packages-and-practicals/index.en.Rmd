## Introduction

Do you have a R package that's just on GitHub? Therefore, unlike when a package is on CRAN checks are not being run on that package on a regular basis. CRAN is rolling release, so any day one of your packages's dependency packages could be updated breaking your package.

Or maybe you teach a course that runs once a year and it has some R practical sessions? The slightly annoying thing can be when you come to rerun your practical after a year several R packages have been updated and now you have to work out how to fix the situation.

We'll see how to use GitHub Actions to run checks on an automated regular basis.
