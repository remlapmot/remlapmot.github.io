## Introduction

Do you have a R package that's just on GitHub? Therefore, unlike when a package is on CRAN checks are not being run on that package on a regular basis unless you run them locally. CRAN is rolling release, so any day one of your packages's dependency packages could be updated - breaking your package.

Or maybe you teach a course that runs once a year and it has some R practical sessions? It can annoy when you come to rerun your practical after a year and find that several R packages have been updated and now you have to work out how to fix the situation. Of course for this situation we could use renv to record the packages and their versions. But the issue with this is that your course participants will then need to use renv and also be wondering why you use packages that are a year out of date. Alternatively you might install all your packages from a single date, meaning you can restore them using the a snapshot date from the Public Posit Package Manager (now the only snapshot)

We'll see how to use GitHub Actions to run checks on an automated regular basis.
