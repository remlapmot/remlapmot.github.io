## Introduction

Have you ever typed `Amazon` into the Google Chrome address bar and seen the address bar indicate that it's now searching the Amazon site? It turns out this is because Google Chrome has a feature called site search shortcuts.

We can see what default shortcuts Chrome provides by going to <chrome://settings/searchEngines>.

From here we can see that we can define our own shortcuts, so let's define some helpful ones related to R ^[I am following a similar excellent [blogpost](https://chromeunboxed.com/chrome-site-search-shortcuts) by Chrome Unboxed.] and statistics.

## Helpful site search shortcuts for R and statistics

[METACRAN](https://r-pkg.org/) provides several amazingly useful services around CRAN.

*  A shortcut for searching the METACRAN CRAN mirror on GitHub

```
Name: CRAN mirror on GitHub
Shortcut: @cran
URL with %s in place of query:
https://github.com/search?q=user%3Acran%20%s&ref=opensearch&type=code
```

* A shortcut for searching for a package description on METACRAN

```
Name: Search METACRAN
Shortcut: @metacran
URL with %s in place of query:
https://r-pkg.org/search.html/?q=%s
```

* A shortcut for searching using [Rseek](https://rseek.org/)

```
Name: Search Rseek
Shortcut: @rseek
URL with %s in place of query:
https://rseek.org/?q=%s
```

* A shortcut for searching [R-universe](https://r-universe.dev/)

```

Shortcut: @runi

* A shortcut for searching the third edition of the Oxford Dictionary of Statistics

```

https://www.oxfordreference.com/search?source=%2F10.1093%2Facref%2F9780199679188.001.0001%2Facref-9780199679188&q=%s
```

And of course we could define many more.
