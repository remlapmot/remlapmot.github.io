Have you ever typed `Amazon` into the Google Chrome address bar and seen the address bar indicate that it's now searching the Amazon site? It turns out this is because Google Chrome has a feature called site search shortcuts.

We can see what these shortcouts are by going to <chrome://settings/searchEngines>.

From here we can see that we can define our own shortcuts, so let's define some helpful ones related to R ^[I am following a similar excellent [blogpost](https://chromeunboxed.com/chrome-site-search-shortcuts) by Chrome Unboxed.].

* A shortcut for searching the CRAN mirror on GitHub

```
Name: CRAN mirror on GitHub
Shortcut: @cran
URL with %s in place of query:
https://github.com/search?q=user%3Acran%20%s&ref=opensearch&type=code
```

Or we could search the third edition of the Oxford Dictionary of Statistics

```
Name: Oxford Dictionary of Statistics
Shortcut: @stats
URL with %s in place of query:
https://www.oxfordreference.com/search?source=%2F10.1093%2Facref%2F9780199679188.001.0001%2Facref-9780199679188&q=%s
```
