<p>Most proficient Stata users have come across the <code>version</code> command. This is an incredibly powerful command, which simply by issuing say</p>
<pre class="stata"><code>version 18</code></pre>
<p>at the top of a do-file or within a program (typically in an ado-file) means that you have pretty much guaranteed your code will run in the same way when you come to run it later (most likely in a newer version of Stata).</p>
<p>Several years ago I wrote the <strong>reffadjust</strong> package <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-palmer-sj-2014">Palmer et al. 2014</a>)</span> as part of some work using random effects models <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-mcdw-sim-2012">Macdonald-Wallis et al. 2012</a>)</span>. It has two programs <code>reffadjustsim</code> and <code>reffadjust4nlcom</code> which use the output of various random effects commands, including those from MLwiN, run from Stata using the user-written <code>runmlwin</code> command <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-leckie-jss-2013">Leckie and Charlton 2013</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The <strong>reffadjust</strong> package doesn’t have many users and over the years I hadn’t regularly checked if the programs were still working. But in the ado-files I had set <code>version 13</code>, which gave me some residual confidence that the programs might still work.</p>
<p>However, a few years ago, when I eventually did run some test code I saw that the <code>reffadjustsim</code> tests were failing for MLwiN/<code>runmlwin</code> models. I didn’t have time to investigate further at this point, and I didn’t have any intuition whether the error resulted from a change in MLwiN, <code>runmlwin</code>, or Stata.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this year one of my colleagues mentioned that they were using <strong>reffadjust</strong> in their work and had observed the same error with <code>reffadjustsim</code>. My guilt kicked in, and I eventually found some time to investigate. I discovered that since I wrote the package, Stata processes matrix row and column stripes (essentially the row and column names) in a more advanced way. This meant that the row and column stripes for covariance elements in the <code>e(V)</code> matrix (the variance-covariance matrix of parameter estimates) from MLwiN/<code>runmlwin</code> models were being renamed when I hadn’t intended them to be which caused the error.</p>
<p>But wait … I had specified <code>version 13</code> at the top of my program, so why was this update in later versions of Stata taking effect?</p>
<p>I couldn’t work it out, so I had to ask Stata Technical Support. They were kind enough to tell me that there’s an additional method of invoking the <code>version</code> command which controls what is known as the “user version”. There are some modifications in new versions of Stata which are exempt from the basic invocation of the <code>version</code> command. The “user version”, is set by <code>version #, user</code>, and holds these additional modifications to the required version.</p>
<p>Naturally, this is explained in the <code>version</code> helpfile and <a href="https://www.stata.com/manuals/pversion.pdf">manual entry</a>, which I admit I had not read until this point. Simply editing the top of my program to</p>
<pre class="stata"><code>version 13
version 13, user</code></pre>
<p>fixed my error. It turns out that both lines are required because the second line only sets the “user version”.</p>
<p>In summary, my <code>reffadjustsim</code> command works again for MLwiN/<code>runmlwin</code> models. The updated version is available from <a href="https://github.com/remlapmot/reffadjust">its GitHub repo</a>. And if you ever need <em>fuller</em> reproducibility in your Stata do-file or program remember to set both the version and the user version.</p>
