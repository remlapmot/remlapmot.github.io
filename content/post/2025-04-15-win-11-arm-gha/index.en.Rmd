## Introduction

GitHub has announced that Windows ARM64 runners are [now available](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-04-14-windows-arm64-hosted-runners-now-available-in-public-preview/) under the `windows-11-arm` label.

I help maintain an R package, TwoSampleMR, which has quite alot of users. The package is not on CRAN because several of its dependencies are only on GitHub, and for a package to be on CRAN essentially all of its dependencies must also be on CRAN. So I am always interested to try installing the package on new operating systems and architectures.

## Setting up R AARCH64 on Windows on ARM

### Avoiding confusion with the default runner software

First of all it is important to mention that the x86_64 version of R 4.4.2 and Rtools 4.4 are included in the [default software set](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/windows/Windows2022-Readme.md) for the `windows-latest` GitHub Actions runner. And its binaries are on the `PATH` environment variable. As a result if you run `R`, `Rscript`, or `R CMD batch` etc. in a shell in the runner you will obtain the x86_64 version of R. Let's say this is not what we want.

So to setup the ARM version of R we need to install it ourselves.






## Summary

I have shown how to .

We are now in the interesting position in that GitHub Actions has Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu Linux all available on both x86_64 and ARM.
