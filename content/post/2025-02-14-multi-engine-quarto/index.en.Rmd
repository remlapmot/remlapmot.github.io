## Introduction

Have you ever needed to present the code and output for several languages in the same document or website? A Quarto document can only run a single engine. But of course there are already several work around solutions even within Quarto available. Those include:

* simply writing out the different language code cells but making them unevaluated/not executed chunks (this is done alot on the Quarto website). One could even include saved plots from the different languages;
* if you had a combination of languages from which you can call one from the other, such as using **reticulate** from within R to run Python, or using **Statamarkdown** from within R to run Stata, then these can be combined in a Quarto document;
* or for some languages like R and Python we could even embed full WebAssembly implementations of the language (webR and Pyodide respectively) within a webpage (but that seems a little overkill for my work).

I recently stumbled across [Quarto's embed shortcode](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/notebook-embed.html). This allows another (or selected cells from another) Quarto document to be included/embedded in a Quarto document. A thought occurred to me, what if the embedded Quarto document/s used a different engine? Would that work? Remarkably (to me) the answer turns out to be that it does!

## Using the embed shortcode to create an effectively multi-engine Quarto document

In the example below I'm using I'm using a [tabset](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html#tabsets) in a html document using the knitr engine. We embed the documents using the alternative engines using the `{{</* embed */>}}` shortcode as follows.

````{verbatim, file="multi-engine.qmd", lang="markdown"}
````

* *python-code.qmd* uses the `jupyter: python3` engine ([documentation for using Python in Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/python.html));
* *stata-code.qmd* uses the `jupyter: nbstata` engine ([documentation for nbstata](https://hugetim.github.io/nbstata/));
* and *julia-code.qmd* uses `engine: julia` or the IJulia Jupyter kernel via e.g., `jupyter: julia-1.11` ([documentation for using Julia in Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/julia.html))

I am assuming that you have setup each engine beforehand.

Rendering the master Quarto document results in the embedded documents being executed and embedded within it.

## Summary

In summary, I have shown how to use the Quarto embed shortcode to embed Quarto documents using alternative engines to create an effectively multi-engine Quarto document.
