## Introduction

Have you ever needed to present the code and output for several languages in the same document or website? A Quarto document can only run a single engine. But of course there are already several work around solutions even within Quarto available. Those include:

* simply writing out the different language code cells but making them not evaluated, one could even include saved plots from the different languages (this is done alot on the Quarto website);
* if you had a combination of languages from which you can call one from the other, such as using **reticulate** from within R to run Python, then these can be combined in a single engine Quarto document.

The other day I stumbled across [Quarto's embed shortcode](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/notebook-embed.html). This allows another (or selected cells from another) Quarto document to be included/embedded in a Quarto document. A thought occurred to me, what if the embedded Quarto document/s used a different engine? Would that work? Remarkably the answer turns out to be that it does!

## Using the embed shortcode to make a effectively multi-engine Quarto document

We start our Quarto document using either the knitr or Jupyter python3 engine then we can embed the documents using the alternative engines as follows (here I'm using a [tabset](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html#tabsets) in a html document).

```{verbatim, file="multi-engine.qmd"}
```

* *_python-code.qmd* uses `jupyter: python3` ([documentation for using Python in Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/python.html))
* *_stata-code.qmd* uses `jupyter: nbstata` ([documentation for nbstata](https://hugetim.github.io/nbstata/))
* *_julia-code.qmd* uses `engine: julia` or the IJulia Jupyter kernel via e.g., `jupyter: julia-1.11` ([documentation for using Juliain Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/julia.html))

I am assuming that you have setup each engine beforehand.

And voila rendering the master Quarto document results in the embedded documents being executed and embedded within it.

## Summary

In summary, I have shown how to use the Quarto embed shortcode to embed Quarto documents using alternative engines to create an effectively multi-engine Quarto document.
