## Introduction

Any new project using Python or Jupyter now needs to use a virtual environment. This is just a directory within your project which will contain the dependency Python packages and perhaps the Python installation (or pointers to the Python installation).

There are many Python project managers, the new and extremly fast project manager is [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

In this post I will explain how to use the [nbstata](https://hugetim.github.io/nbstata/) Jupyter kernel within a uv virtual environment on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

I am a contributor to the excellent [Statamarkdown](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Statamarkdown) R package by Doug Hemken which can also be used in Quarto documents using the knitr engine. But in this post I'll be using nbstata because nbstata uses pystata which is StataCorp's official Python package (included in each Stata installation) and is their official way of integrating Stata in Python. As such pystata and hence nbstata have more features than Statamarkdown can provide.

And it is worth emphasising how useful virtual environments are because it is very easy to get oneself in a complete mess on one's computer with regards Python, as you will likely end up with many different versions installed, and then chaos ensues regarding which versions of dependency packages your different projects require.

## Setup basics

On your machine you need to have

* Stata installed and know the location of the installation
  * and check that within the installation their is the utilities directory containing the pystata directory
* uv must be installed, see [its docs for more info](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
* and of course a text editor and a terminal.
* On Windows I would recommend using Git Bash (which is bundled with [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win)) for running the setup script in the next section.

## A shell script to setup the virtual environment

What follows are the shell commands we need to run to setup our virtual environment.

It's for macOS but I put comments in the places where amendments are required for either Windows or Linux. 

Note that currently on macOS and Linux there cannot be any spaces in the filepath to your virtual environment.

* On Linux we need to ensure that the directory containing our stata/stata-mp binary is on `PATH`.

```bash
# export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/stata18
```

* We need to ensure that our Python installation will be able to find the pystata package. We can do this by defining the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.

```bash
# Required so nbstata can find pystata package
export PYTHONPATH=/Applications/Stata/utilities
# Linux: export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/stata18/utilities
# Windows: export PYTHONPATH="C:/Program Files/Stata18/utilities"
```

* We then setup the virtual environment. This will create a directory in our project called _.venv_. I prefer to explicitly set the version of Python I am using.

```bash
uv venv --python 3.13
```

* We then activate the virtual environment

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows: source .venv/Scripts/activate
```

* Now we can install the required Python dependency packages.

```bash
# Install nbstata dependency Python packages
uv pip install jupyterlab nbstata jupyterlab_stata_highlight2

# Additional Python packages if using parameterised Quarto documents
# uv pip install papermill python-dotenv jupyter-cache
```

* Then we setup the nbstata Jupyter kernel

```bash
python -m nbstata.install
```

The nbstata docs states that the --sys-prefix flag may be required in a virutal environment but I haven't found that to be the case.

* Then we issue the commands to do our actual work; for example rendering a Quarto document using the `jupyter: nbstata` engine.

```bash
quarto render index.qmd --execute --execute-daemon-restart
```

An example _index.qmd_ document could be:

````{verbatim, lang="plaintext"}
---
title: My example nbstata document
jupyter: nbstata
---

```{stata}
display "Hello, World!"
```
````

Note that Quarto documents using the nbstata kernel can also be embedded within other documents, [as I have described in a previous post](https://remlapmot.github.io/post/2025/multi-engine-quarto/).

* And when you have finished your work you can deactivate the virtual environment

```bash
deactivate
```

## Summary

I have shown how to setup and run the nbstata Jupyter kernel within a uv virtual environment.
