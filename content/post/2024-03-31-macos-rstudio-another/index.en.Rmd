## Introduction: the problem -- how to obtain a second instance of RStudio Desktop

On macOS when RStudio Desktop is open it can be a bit inconvenient to open a second (or third or fourth) instance of it.
For example, it's not possible to simply click the icon in the dock (or right click on that etc) as we might do on Windows.
Within RStudio Desktop we could select *File | Open File...* or *File | Open Project...* but I've never found that very intuitive and somehow I've never got used to using the command pallette.
If you have several directories configured as RStudio projects (with *.Rproj*) files you could open those from the top right project drop down menu or double click them from within Finder.
It turns out that in a terminal we can issue the following `open` command to achieve opening another instance of RStudio Desktop (note RStudio Desktop needs to be installed in your Applications directory for this to work).

```bash
open -n -a RStudio.app
```

## Making an Automator app to open a new instance of RStudio Desktop

macOS comes with Automator, open that from your Applications directory.
Then select *File | New* and select *Application* and click *Choose*.
Then from the left most menu select *Utilities* double click *Run Shell Script*.
Leave the shell as zsh but delete the `cat` text in the box with the `open` command above.

Then press Cmd + S or *File | Save* and save your application in your Applications folder.
Give the app a distinct name such as *RStudio-another.app* or whatever you prefer.
Now quit Automator.

We can assign a nice icon to our new app.^[I follow the approach detailed on [this](https://www.idownloadblog.com/2023/01/19/how-to-change-app-icons-mac/) blog.]

* First download a nice icon from say [this](https://github.com/amirmasoudabdol/rstudio-icons/tree/main/Icons/macOS/Rectangle) repo of logos kindly designed for RStudio (I chose the dark one).
* Then navigate to the our new app in Finder and press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>I<kbd>.
* Then drag the *.icns* file onto the icon in the top left corner of the info box.
And tada your app will now use this icon!

And you can even drag the app from Finder onto your dock.

## Summary

We have created an Automator application which runs a shell script to open a new instance of RStudio Desktop.
