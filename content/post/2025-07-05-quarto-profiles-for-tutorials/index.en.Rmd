## Introduction

I previously posted about creating tutorial worksheets for 4 different Quarto engines using the conditional content thingyTODO.

Thanks to a vignette in the quarto R package I realised there is a more convenient (and indeed less hacky) way to create tutorial documents using Quarto profiles.


## An honorable mention about dynamic metadata

## Summary

I have shown how to create Quarto profiles for creating tutorial worksheets; one for the questions and one for the solutions from the same Quarto document; for several Quarto engines (`knitr`, `jupyter: python3`, `jupyter: nbstata`, and `engine: julia`). I have also shown how additional metadata may be written into your Quarto document in these engines which can be used in conjunction with parameterised documents.
