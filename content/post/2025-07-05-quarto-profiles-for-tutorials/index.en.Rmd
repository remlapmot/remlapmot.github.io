## Introduction

I [previously posted](https://remlapmot.github.io/post/2025/quarto-conditional-content/) about creating tutorial worksheets for 4 different Quarto engines using [conditional content](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/conditional.html). However, that approach is a bit hacky and I wasn't very happy with it.

Thanks to a [vignette by Christophe Devrieux](https://quarto-dev.github.io/quarto-r/articles/dynamic-metadata.html) in the quarto R package I realised there is a more convenient (and indeed less hacky) way to create tutorial documents using Quarto profiles (I don't use the approach in the vignette but it led me to relevant Quarto documentation page).

My aim is the following

> Have a single Quarto document from which both the question and solution documents can be rendered for a tutorial.

As a reminder, as I showed in my previous post, this has long been trivial with R Markdown and knitr because they allow programmtic chunk options. Therefore, implementing this in a Quarto document using the knitr engine is also trivial. However, it is other Quarto engines which are problematic because as far as I know they don't allow programmtic chunk options and they don't the equivalent of `!expr`.

## Quarto profiles

Profiles documents [on this page](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/profiles.html).

And specifically, we shall make use of [conditional content dependent upon profile](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/profiles.html#profile-content).


## An honorable mention about dynamic metadata

## Summary

I have shown how to create Quarto profiles for creating tutorial worksheets; one for the questions and one for the solutions from the same Quarto document; for several Quarto engines (`knitr`, `jupyter: python3`, `jupyter: nbstata`, and `engine: julia`). I have also shown how additional metadata may be written into your Quarto document in these engines which can be used in conjunction with parameterised documents.
