## Introduction

When teaching, for my practicals and for about half of my lectures I find myself preparing them using R Markdown and laterly Quarto. The other half of my presentations I prepare in Powerpoint. I enjoy preparing the material in R Markdown and Quarto because it gives me a reproducible way of regenerating my material every year.

Recently, the subject of accessibility has become more prominent within Universities. My University uses Blackboard for its online learning environment (OLE). There are other OLEs, e.g., Moodle, Canvas, and others; they all work in essentially the same way in that they provide a website per Unit/Module within a secure online system. Now every document I upload into Blackboard receives and accessibility score and each module I teach receives an overall accessibility score. My University uses Accessibility Report LTI 1.3 to generate these scores.

What follows is a set of tips I have discovered which help improve the score for individual documents and hence your overall module score.

## Tip 1: Replace all pdfs with docx, pptx, or html for the quick win

If you upload a pdf to get a high accessibility score it needs to be a special type of pdf, called a 'tagged pdf', otherwise it will get a terrible score (approx. 6%).

As I will show in the following tips, it is much easier to make Word, Powerpoint, and html document accessible, and so if you are looking for the most effective boost in your accessibility scores simply remove all pdf documents from your site and replace with Word, Powerpoint, or html documents.

## Tip 2: Add alt text to all figures

I guess like many R users the first I remember hearing about accessibility was that there is this thing called alt text and it's good practice for html documents to provide alt text summaries of every image they contain.

It turns out that other types of document can also hold alt text for images; including Word, Powerpoint, and pdf documents.

As per tip 1, let's say we have a Quarto or R Markdown document which we render to docx and html output formats. To add alt text to figures in the html document we use the `fig-alt` (`fig.alt` in R Markdown) chunk option. However, it turns out that alt text for a Word document is taken from the `fig-cap` (`fig.cap` in R Markdown) chunk option. Therefore, I specify both `fig-alt` and `fig-cap` chunk options in all code chunks generating figures.

## Tip 3: (The nightmare of generating) Tagged pdfs ðŸ˜¬

It is possible for a pdf to obtain a perfect accessibility score. As I said above it must be a tagged pdf.

You can check if a pdf has tags by opening it in Adobe Acrobat Reader then bringing up the document properties - the info is in the bottom left of Description tab.

It turns out that we can only create tagged pdfs in a few ways; 

* by exporting a Word or Powerpoint document to pdf within those programs
  * note macOS users must select the _Best for electronic distribution and accessibility..._ option
    <img src="/post/2025/accessibility/img/powerpoint-macos-pdf-export.png" alt="Screenshot of Powerpoint export to pdf window on macOS." width="630" style="display: block; margin: auto;">  
  * Word and Powerpoint for Windows and Word and Powerpoint online export tagged pdfs by default
* by printing html documents to pdf (Print | Save as pdf) in Chrome (and the other Chromium based browsers such as Edge)
  * In my testing I find that by default Safari and Firefox do not generate tagged pdfs
* Of course the paid for professional version of Adobe Acrobat allows users to [add tags to pdfs](https://helpx.adobe.com/uk/acrobat/using/editing-document-structure-content-tags.html), but I don't have that, and I assuming you don't either.

The surprise here is that pdf documents produced by LaTeX (and typst) by default do not generate tagged pdfs. Therefore, do not render to `pdf`/`typst` output formats in Quarto nor `pdf_document` in R Markdown.

### Generating tagged pdfs in LaTeX

It turns out it [is possible to generate a tagged pdf from LaTeX](https://latex3.github.io/tagging-project/documentation/prototype-usage-instructions), but this is extrememly inconvenient from R Markdown and Quarto. First use Quarto/R Markdown to generate the TeX file of your document. You then require [the following LaTeX packages](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/605142).

```r
tinytex::tlmgr_install(c('latex-lab', 'pdfmanagement-testphase', 'tagpdf', 'luamml'))
```

You then need to amend the very top of your TeX file to have a `\DocumentMetadata{tagging=on}` entry. And possibly using the _unicode-math_ package is helpful.

```latex
\DocumentMetadata{tagging=on}
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{unicode-math}
\begin{document}
% the rest of your document ...
\end{document}
```

When I tried this I found that compiling with LuaLaTeX did generate a tagged pdf.

```sh
lualatex mydocument.tex
```

But I cannot face going through this hassle for every document I produce. So the slightly unexpected take home message here is that if you want to give your students a pdf document, the most convenient way to produce a tagged pdf is to render your Quarto document to docx or html and then export the pdf from within either Word or Chrome.
