## Introduction

I was interested to see whether and how well R would run on the new RISC-V architecture.

A while ago I read that RISC-V is now a [first class architecture for Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/blog/empowering-risc-v-with-open-source-through-ubuntu).

This got me thinking, instead of having to build R from source maybe the `r-base` package might be available for RISC-V. It turns out that this is indeed the case, the architecture we are interested in is `riscv64`. The launchpad page for r-base is [here](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/r-base). Clicking through the subpages for each version of Ubuntu I can see that R is available for RISC-V from Ubuntu Focal Fossa onwards (for which the version of R is 3.6.3; and the latest version of Ubuntu has the current version of R of 4.5.0).

## Emulating RISC-V on an Apple Silicon Mac

My setup is that I'm on an Apple Silicon M4 MacBook Air. I thought this might be promising to use because this has an ARM processor which is also a reduced instruction set architecture.

I wondered whether to try UTM or qemu at the command line. I tried UTM first but I couldn't make any progress. So I found a tip online saying that RISC-V Ubuntu could be launched under Qemu on Ubuntu Linux using

```sh
qemu-system-riscv64 \
  -machine virt \
  -nographic \
  -m 12288 -smp 4 \
  -bios /usr/lib/riscv64-linux-gnu/opensbi/generic/fw_jump.elf \
  -kernel /usr/lib/u-boot/qemu-riscv64_smode/uboot.elf \
  -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=eth0 \
  -netdev user,id=eth0,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22 \
  -drive file=ubuntu-24.10-preinstalled-server-riscv64.img,format=raw,if=virtio
```

Firstly one needs to obtain the Ubuntu img. Following [this incredible guide by Canonical](https://canonical-ubuntu-boards.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/how-to/qemu-riscv/) we can choose one of the three versions of Ubuntu listed (Noble, Oracular, Plucky).

The image downloads as an _.img.xz_ archive, which you can extract by installing `xz`

```sh
brew install xz
```

and running

```sh
xz --decompress ubuntu-24.10-preinstalled-server-riscv64.img.xz
```

The extracted file is about 4GB, but later on I realised I needed a slightly larger harddisk for the virtual machine, so I increased it to 8GB with the following command.

```sh
qemu-img resize ubuntu-24.10-preinstalled-server-riscv64.img 8G
```

I then realised that I needed qemu on my Mac. Again Homebrew to the rescue with the following command.

```sh
brew install qemu u-boot-tools
```

(Admittedly I don't think I ended up using the _u-boot-tools_) Next I needed the two files; _fw_jump.elf_ and _uboot.elf_. I had a look in _/opt/homebrew/Cellar/qemu/10.0.2/_ but I couldn't work out if they are in there or not (there are some zip archives). I then remembered reading a comment that a user had copied them from an Ubuntu installation. I resorted to the same trick thanks to Docker.

```sh
docker run -it --rm --platform linux/arm64 -v $PWD:/home ubuntu:24.04 sh -c "apt update && apt upgrade -y && apt install -y opensbi qemu-system-misc u-boot-qemu && cp /usr/lib/u-boot/qemu-riscv64_smode/uboot.elf /home/uboot.elf && cp /usr/lib/riscv64-linux-gnu/opensbi/generic/fw_jump.elf /home/fw_jump.elf"
```

This saves the two files to the current working directory, so I could modify my call to `qemu` to be as follows.

```sh
qemu-system-riscv64 \
  -machine virt \
  -nographic \
  -m 12288 -smp 4 \
  -bios fw_jump.elf \
  -kernel uboot.elf \
  -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=eth0 \
  -netdev user,id=eth0,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22 \
  -drive file=ubuntu-24.10-preinstalled-server-riscv64.img,format=raw,if=virtio
```

A little bit to my surprise this worked. And I was presented with the login to Ubuntu server. The default username is _ubuntu_ and the default password is _ubuntu_. On login you are immediately prompted to change the password but then you're in.

So next it's essentially standard Ubuntu commands to update the system and install r-base. And I also install r-base-dev to obtain the necessary compilers to build any source packages containing code which needs to be compiled.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install -y r-base r-base-dev
```

Then as usual we launch R with `R`.
