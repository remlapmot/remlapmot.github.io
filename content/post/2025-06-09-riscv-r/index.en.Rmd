## Introduction

I was interested to see whether and how well R would run on the new RISC-V architecture.

I read that RISC-V was now a first class architecture for Ubuntu.

This got me thinking, instead of having to build R from source maybe the `r-base` package might be available for RISC-V. It turns out that this is indeed the case, the architecture is `riscv64`.


## Emulating RISC-V on an Apple Silicon Mac

My setup is that I'm on an Apple Silicon M4 MacBook Air. I thought this might be promising to use because this has an ARM processor which is also a reduced instruction set architecture.

I wondered whether to try UTM or qemu at the command line. I tried UTM first but I couldn't make any progress. So I found a tip online saying that RISC-V Ubuntu could be launched under Qemu using

```sh
qemu-system-riscv64 \
  -machine virt \
  -nographic \
  -m 12288 -smp 4 \
  -bios fw_jump.elf \
  -kernel uboot.elf \
  -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=eth0 \
  -netdev user,id=eth0,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22 \
  -drive file=ubuntu-24.10-preinstalled-server-riscv64.img,format=raw,if=virtio
```
