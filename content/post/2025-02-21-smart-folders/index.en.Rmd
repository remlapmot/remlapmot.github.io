## Introduction

Somehow when I'm switching projects I naturally start with Finder. I'm sure if I became a Terminal warrior there are faster ways of searching for files (e.g. TODO). I know there are many ways to avoid this, e.g., using Alfred; and indeed I do have this fantastic tip that allows Alfred to find .Rproj files setup (and I would guess Raycast can do the same, but I'm not a Raycast user). Navigating through my mess of nested directories wastes time and clicks.

I realised that Finder on macOS has a helpful feature called Smart Folders. We can use this to setup a saved search of _.Rproj_ files (and/or _.code-workspace_ files) to allow us to see all the _.Rproj_ files on our computer making finding and opening projects from within Finder convenient and fast.

## Setting up a Smart Folder of your RStudio project files

In Finder;

* navigate to the folder you want your search to start in, either your home folder or your Documents folder are obvious candidates
* click File | New Smart Folder

* near the top right corner click the plus button next to the _Save_ button.

* Now we need to add the _File extension_ option to the choices, click _Name_ near the top left, then _Other..._

* Then search for File extension and check the box on the right handside

* enter Rproj in the box (it doesn't seem to matter if you include the . first)

* click save and give it a sensible name, e.g., _Rproj_

And you'll see the new virtual folder appear on the left Finder sidebar.

You can repeat for other useful file extensions, for example VSCode/Positron project files (_.code-workspace_ files).

## Summary

I have shown how to create a Smart Folder of your RStudio Project files for convenient and fast project launching.
