## Introduction


## Widening the accordion

First we need to work out what type of element it is. To do this in Google Chrome right click on a part of the accordion and click _Inspect_.

We can see that the accordion is a div of class deo-accordion. And we can see that it's `max-width` is currently set to 40em which is 640 pixels.

Therefore to modify this we need to write the CSS for this with a larger `max-width`. It turns out Blackboard does not allow us to put CSS in a `<style>` tag directly in a component's source code. Therefore, we put the following in a file called _mystyle.css_. The 60em is equivalent to 960 pixels.

```css
.deo-accordion {
  max-width: 60em;
}
```

We then upload this file to our Blackboard site's _Content_ area. Once uploaded obtain the _Permanent URL_ of the file by clicking the dropdown arrow to the right of the filename and selecting _360Â° View_.

Within the content of the item on your Blackboard page which contains the accordion, click edit, then click the `<>` symbol to enter editing source code mode. At the bottom of the code enter the following line - replacing the PERMANENT_URL and save the changes.

```html
<link href="YOUR_FILES_PERMANENT_URL" rel="stylesheet">
```

And you should find that you have a wider accordion.
