## Introduction


## Widening the accordion

First we need to work out what type of element it is. To do this in Google Chrome right click on a part of the accordion and click _Inspect_.

```css
.deo-accordion {
  max-width: 60em;
}
```

It turns out 60em is equivalent to 960 pixels in width, whereas the original width of 40em is only 640 pixels.

```html
<link href="PERMANENT_URL_FROM_FILE_MORE_INFO" rel="stylesheet">
```


## Summary

I have shown how to widen the accordion on a Blackboard page.
